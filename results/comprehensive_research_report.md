# Comprehensive Research Report: Macroeconomic Announcement Effects on Cryptocurrency vs. Stock Markets

**Analysis Date:** 2025-09-29
**Research Period:** 10-Year Comprehensive Analysis

## Abstract

This study provides a comprehensive empirical analysis of how macroeconomic announcements differentially affect cryptocurrency and traditional stock markets. Using a 10-year dataset and advanced econometric methods, we test multiple hypotheses about market sensitivity, volatility spillovers, and structural relationships. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on cryptocurrency market behavior and macro-financial linkages.

## Research Questions

1. Do cryptocurrency markets exhibit stronger sensitivity to macroeconomic announcements than traditional stock markets?
2. Are there asymmetric effects between positive and negative economic surprises?
3. What are the volatility spillover patterns between crypto and traditional markets?
4. Have these relationships changed over time (structural breaks)?
5. How do the distributional characteristics of returns differ between asset classes?
