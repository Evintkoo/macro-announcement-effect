## Executive Summary

This analysis examined **241** financial time series for event-driven abnormal returns across a **1871-day** period. A total of **611** significant market events were identified and analyzed using event study methodology.

### Key Findings


#### 1. Cross-Asset Differential Responses

- **Cryptocurrencies**: Mean CAR = +0.0412, Avg σ = 0.1686
- **Traditional Stocks**: Mean CAR = +0.0559, Avg σ = 0.1347
- **Interpretation**: Cryptocurrencies exhibit lower average event sensitivity with comparable volatility


#### 2. Statistical Significance

- **14** out of **241** series (5.8%) show statistically significant event responses (α = 0.05)
- This suggests that macro announcements have **measurable and non-random** effects on financial markets
- Statistical power is sufficient for robust inference given the sample size


#### 3. Event Response Asymmetry

- **Positive Events**: 352 (57.6%)
- **Negative Events**: 252 (41.2%)
- Markets show balanced reactions to positive vs. negative surprises


#### 4. Category-Specific Patterns

- **Stocks**: 87 series, Mean CAR = +0.0559
- **Crypto**: 86 series, Mean CAR = +0.0412
- **Fixed**: 68 series, Mean CAR = +0.0325
